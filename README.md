# heads_or_tails

This program simulates a "Heads or Tails" game between two players. Each player starts with a certain number of coins. In each round, a coin is flipped, and depending on the result ("head" or "tail"), one player wins a coin while the other loses one. The game continues until one of the players runs out of coins. At the end of the game, the program outputs the winner's name, the number of rounds played, and each player's winning chances.

The program demonstrates the basics of object-oriented programming in PHP, such as creating and using classes, constructors, and methods, as well as working with loops and random numbers.
